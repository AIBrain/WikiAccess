c# classes that download data direct from Wikidata and Wikipedia

I wrote these classes specifically for my biographical validation work (see WikidataBioValidate)  Consequently, the only bits that I know work are the items I specifically required for my own esoteric project. For example. they totally ignore references. There are likely some datatypes that are not handled. The URL parameters ae hardcoded to produce what I liked!

Nevertheless, they work for me and provide a foundation for future work.
